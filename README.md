# Authentication and authorization system - backend:

I'm creating an authentication and authorization backend system using `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `TypeScript` and `mongo db`.

**P.S: [docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required**

## installation:

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cs-fedy/auth-system`
2. Change your current directory to the repo dir: `cd auth-system`
3. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the db.
4. If not working with node as a container then install yarn: `np i -g yarn`
5. Install all the dependencies:  `yarn install`
6. Run the system in a dev env: `yarn run dev`

## used tools:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
2. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
4. [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/): MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.
5. [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/): Deliver Exceptional Email Experiences.
6. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler.
